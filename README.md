# Smart Voice Assistant

A local voice assistant powered by LLaMA 3.1 for daily task management. All conversations include timestamps for accurate time-based operations like alarms and reminders. The system runs entirely on your local network for complete privacy.

## System Requirements

**Android Device:**
- Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- Microphone permission
- WiFi connection

**Server (PC/Laptop):**
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama with LLaMA 3.1 model
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- ~5GB storage for LLaMA model

## Installation

### 1. Setup Server

```bash
cd PCpart

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai/download
# Then pull LLaMA model
ollama pull llama3.1

# Start server
python reciver.py
```

Server will run on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

### 2. Setup Android App

1. Open `Voice Asistant` folder in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle (wait for dependencies to download)
3. Connect Android device or start emulator
4. Build and run

Grant permissions when prompted:
- Microphone (for voice input)
- Notifications (for alarms)
- Exact alarms (for precise scheduling)

### 3. Configure Connection

**Auto-Discovery (Recommended):**
1. Ensure phone and PC on same WiFi
2. Open app → Settings (⚙️)
3. Tap "Auto-Discover Server"
4. Tap "Save Settings"

**Manual Configuration:**
1. Find PC's IP address (`ipconfig` on Windows, `ifconfig` on Mac/Linux)
2. In app Settings, enter IP and port (5000)
3. Save and test connection

## Usage

### Conversations
- **Text:** Type message and tap send
- **Voice:** Tap "Speak" button and speak naturally

All messages automatically include current time for context.

### Setting Alarms
Examples:
- "Set an alarm in 30 minutes"
- "Wake me up at 7 AM tomorrow"
- "Remind me in 2 hours"

The AI calculates exact alarm time using the timestamp in your message.

### Taking Notes
Examples:
- "Take note: Buy groceries"
- "Remember I have a meeting at 2 PM"
- "Save note: Call John about project"

View notes by tapping "Show Notes" button. Export to text file anytime.

## Architecture

### Android App (Kotlin)
- **MVVM pattern** for clean architecture
- **OkHttp** for networking (120s timeout for LLM responses)
- **Android SpeechRecognizer** for voice input
- **TextToSpeech API** for voice output
- **SharedPreferences** for data persistence
- **RecyclerView** for efficient chat display

### Python Server
- **Flask** web framework with CORS
- **Ollama** for LLaMA 3.1 integration
- Maintains conversation history (up to 50 messages)
- Special command parsing:
  - `XX1 DayName/YYYY-MM-DD/HH:MM` → Alarm
  - `XX2 [content]` → Note

## Dependencies

### Android
```kotlin
implementation "androidx.core:core-ktx:1.16.0"
implementation "com.google.android.material:material:1.11.0"
implementation "com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0"
implementation "com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1"
implementation "org.apache.poi:poi:5.2.3"  // For note export
```

### Python
```
Flask==3.0.0
flask-cors==4.0.0
ollama==0.1.0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to Server
1. Verify server is running (check terminal)
2. Confirm both devices on same WiFi
3. Check firewall (allow Python through)
4. Try manual IP configuration

### Voice Recognition Not Working
1. Grant microphone permission
2. Check internet connection (some devices need it for STT)
3. Speak clearly with minimal background noise

### Alarm Issues
1. Grant "Exact alarms" permission (Android 12+)
2. Check Do Not Disturb settings
3. Ensure device isn't in power-saving mode

### Slow Responses
- First request takes longer (model loading)
- Try smaller model: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
- Close other applications on server PC

## API Documentation

### POST `/receive`
**Request:**
```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
message: "Your message [Current time: 15/01/2025 14:30 (Monday)]"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "AI response or special command"
}
```

**Special Commands:**
- `XX1 Monday/2025-01-15/15:00` → Set alarm
- `XX2 Note content` → Save note
- Plain text → Normal conversation

### POST `/reset`
Clears conversation history.

## Configuration

### Change Server Settings
Edit [reciver.py](PCpart/reciver.py):
```python
MODEL_NAME = "llama3.1"  # Change model
PORT = 5000              # Change port
```

### Change Android Timeouts
Edit [MainActivity.kt](Voice Asistant/app/src/main/java/com/example/voicechatapp/MainActivity.kt):
```kotlin
.connectTimeout(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
.readTimeout(120, TimeUnit.SECONDS)  // LLM response timeout
```
